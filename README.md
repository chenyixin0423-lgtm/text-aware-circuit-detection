# Text-Aware Circuit Component Detection

Applied computer vision project exploring **text-aware circuit schematic understanding**, developed as part of a collaborative academic course project.

## What this repo shows
- Synthetic circuit diagram generation with **explicit textual annotations**
- Text-aware labeling for component labels, net labels, and free annotations
- Supporting scripts for data preparation and YOLO-style detection experiments

## Scope & Notes
- This repository focuses on the **parts I personally implemented** (mainly data generation and text-aware modeling)
- It does **not** include the full baseline system, trained models, or netlist construction logic
- Netlist-related components were handled by other parts of the team and are out of scope here
